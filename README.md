# tap-typeform

This is a [Singer](https://singer.io) tap that produces JSON-formatted data following the [Singer spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/SPEC.md).

This tap:

- Pulls raw data from TypeForms's [API](https://api.typeform.com/forms)
- Extracts the following resources from TypeForm
  - [Responses](https://developer.typeform.com/responses)
      - List of questions on each form added to the configuration in the tap.
      - List of landings of users onto each form added to the configuration in the tap.
      - List of answers completed during each landing onto each form added to the configuration in the tap.
- Outputs the schema for each resource

## Setup

Building follows the conventional Singer setup:

python3 ./setup.py clean
python3 ./setup.py build
python3 ./setup.py install

## Configuration

This tap requires a `config.json` which specifies details regarding an [Authentication token](https://developer.typeform.com/get-started/convert-keys-to-access-tokens/), a list of form ids, a start date for syncing historical data (date format of YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SSZ), and a time period range [daily,hourly] to control what incremental extract date ranges are. See [example.config.json](example.config.json) for an example.

Create the catalog:

```bash
› tap-typeform --config config.json --discover > catalog.json
```

Then to run the extract:

```bash
› tap-typeform --config config.json --catalog catalog.json --state state.json
```

Note that a typical state file looks like this:

```json
{"bookmarks": {"team_table": {"date_to_resume": "2018-08-01 00:00:00"}}}
```
